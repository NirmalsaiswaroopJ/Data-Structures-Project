# Data Structures & Algorithms Project

This project aims to provide implementations of various kinds of data structures including Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Trees in Python. It also includes a menu-driven interface to interact with these data structures.

## Introduction

This project offers Python implementations for fundamental data structures along with a user-friendly menu-driven interface. Each data structure is well-documented and includes basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and more.

## Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It supports operations like push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty.

### 2. Queues

Queues are linear data structures that follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This project includes implementations for linear queues, circular queues, and double-ended queues (dequeues).

### 3. Linked Lists

Linked lists are collections of nodes linked together where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node. This project provides implementations for singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

### 4. Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. This project includes two types of trees:

#### 4.1 Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is a binary tree with the property that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

#### 4.2 AVL Tree

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains a balance factor for each node to ensure the tree remains balanced after insertions and deletions.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python files.
3. Run the desired Python script for the data structure or algorithm you want to explore.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the implementations.
