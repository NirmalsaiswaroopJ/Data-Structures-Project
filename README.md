# Data Structures & Algorithms Implementations

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms. Below is a brief overview of each implementation available in this project.

## Data Structures Implemented:

1. **Stacks**:
    - Linear stack
    - Operations: Push, Pop, Peek, IsEmpty, Display
    - Applications: Arithmetic expression evaluation, Backtracking, Function calls, etc.

2. **Queues**:
    - Linear Queue
    - Circular Queue
    - Double-ended Queue (Deque)
    - Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, IsEmpty, Display
    - Applications: Breadth-first search, CPU Scheduling, Memory Management, etc.

3. **Linked Lists**:
    - Singly Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List
    - Circular Linked List
    - Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Size, Circular Check
    - Applications: Dynamic memory allocation, Symbol tables, etc.

4. **Binary Search Tree**:
    - Operations: Insertion, Search, Pre-order Traversal, In-order Traversal, Post-order Traversal
    - Applications: Searching, Sorting, etc.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python files.
3. Run the desired Python script for the data structure or algorithm you want to explore.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the implementations.
